	abstract={We conduct simulations of Spin Echo Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SESANS) by employing Monte Carlo methods to a setup using four magnetic Wollaston prisms. Our primary focus involves the validation of these models, encompassing monochromatic scenarios across various neutron wavelengths to ascertain the reliability of the simulations. Subsequently, we extend this validation to encompass simulations in time-of-flight mode. Our model consistently and precisely predicts the scattering patterns emanating from dilute spheres in both monochromatic and time-of-flight modes. Notably, it also accurately reproduces the intricate encoding associated with scattering occurring between the third and fourth magnetic Wollaston prism, which provides us with another approach to increase the solid angle coverage of a SESANS instrument. This validation process conclusively demonstrates the efficacy of our simulation methods. Importantly, it paves the way for simulating more intricate and realistic instrumental configurations, broadening the horizons for future research endeavours.},

	abstract = {The spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering (SESANS) technique utilises a series of inclined magnetic fields before and after the sample to encode the scattering angle into the polarisation to obtain a much higher resolution than in conventional SANS. The analogous technique (spin echo modulated SANS (SEMSANS)) implements spin manipulations before the sample only to encode the scattering into an intensity modulation. The technique can be combined with SANS to expand the length scale range probed from 1 nm to microns.
	
	Using McStas we show that using a series of four magnetic Wollaston prisms in two orthogonal pairs with a 90° rotation can be utilised to create SEMSANS modulations in 2-D. These modulations can also be of different periods in each encoding direction. This method can be applied to anisotropic scattering samples. Also this allows for the simultaneous measurement at two orthogonal independent spin-echo lengths. This technique yields directly information about the structure of oriented structures.}

A full virtual spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering instrument is built and tested without and with a realistic scattering sample. It is essential for these simulations to have a simulated sample that also describes the transmitted beam of unscattered neutrons, which usually is not implemented for the simulation of conventional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) instruments. Finally, the workings of a spin-echo modulated small-angle neutron scattering (SEMSANS) instrument are simulated. The simulations are in good agreement with theory and experiments.

We conclude that lengths from 1nm up to 0.01mm can be observed simultaneously in a single measurement. Thus, the combination of SANS and SEMSANS instrument is suited for the simultaneous observation of a wide range of length scales, e.g. for time-resolved studies of kinetic processes in complex multiscale systems.}

The experiments and simulations in accordance demonstrate that a good contrast can be achieved when using a constant field in the triangular coils. In the reported setup only neutrons with certain wavelengths rotate by a Larmor precession angle that spatially modulates their polarization to coincide with the period of a grating installed at the detector position. This is shown by measuring with a broad wavelength range while scanning the echo condition.},

Measurements on a test instrument of this specific Larmor precession technique are in good agreement with the prediction.

Reversing the orientation of two of the magnetised foils in the spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering (SESANS)-instrument in Delft and changing the field settings was sufficient to obtain a modulation with a period in the order of 1mm. We expect to be able to go to a modulation with a period of 20μm. This technique can be used to measure small-angle neutron scattering, analogous to the method used in SESANS, but with the advantage that all the manipulation of the neutron spin occurs before the sample. This means that the technique is insensitive to magnetic perturbations at the sample position. By positioning several of these devices after each other it will be possible to obtain a sharper modulation, or a modulation in two directions.}

The principle is based on the difference in Larmor precession angle in a coil with changing transmission angle, caused by scattering from a sample. A scattering object between two identical coils with opposite precessions causes depolarisation. The latter as a function of the precession field yields a real space correlation function. A modification of this principle of SESANS is introduced enabling to suppress the contribution of inelastic scattering, which changes the precession angle too. The application of this technique is very promising for systems with large correlation lengths and may enable one to measure time dependent effects in correlation lengths with a time resolution of a few seconds. The latter corresponds to the time needed to measure a complete spectrum from which a correlation function in real space is derived.}

Its use as a monochromator and/or analyzer crystal in a triple-axis spectrometer has previously been discussed.

Presented here are detailed measurements of the reflectivity of the (002) reflection for incident neutron energies from 4.5 to 40.0 meV. There are relatively large dips at 15.3 and 23.6 meV which result from competing Bragg reflections. We also point out that the width of the rocking curve increases as the energy is decreased. This must be considered when making resolution function corrections. PG in bulk form has been extremely useful as a higher order filter in the 13.0–15.0 meV range. It is shown below that it can also be used effectively in the very low energy range, 4.5–6.0 meV.}

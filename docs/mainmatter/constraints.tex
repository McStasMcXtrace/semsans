\chapter{Spin-echo length constraints and intensity in instrument design}
\label{chapter:constraints}
\label{c4:constraints}
Two key parameters in SEMSANS instrument design are the accessible $\delta$-range and the intensity at the detector. The first determines the range of samples that can be measured and the second the amount of signal per unit of time, which determines how well you can measure in a given time or similarly the measurement time needed for a required measurement quality. In this chapter, building on the analysis presented in Chapter \ref{c3}, a system of constraints will be presented that together limit the accessible $\delta$ range for each of the designs listed in Table \ref{tab:design-variants}. After discussing the $\delta$-ranges, a coarse estimate for the intensity at the detector for the two source options will be presented. Lastly, the effect of intensity loss due to SANS scattering is discussed by using a very primitive model for scattering based on the sample form factor $P(Q)$. The goal here is to understand the lower $\delta$-limit of the presented instruments better.
\section{Constraints}
\label{c4.1}
The definition of spin-echo length $\delta  = \lambda_0^2L_s\alpha$ as given by Equation \eqref{eq:delta} can be interpreted as saying something about how $\lambda_0, L_s$ and $\alpha$ limit values of $\delta$. Here, $\alpha$ is determined by the precession device field strengths as well as their positions $L_1, L_2$ as discussed in Section \ref{c3.3}. This gives a first source of constraints that will be discussed in Subsection \ref{c4.1.1}. $\delta$ can also be rewritten using modulation frequency $f_0 = \alpha\lambda_0$ to express $\delta$ in terms of $f_0$ instead of $\alpha$, giving
\begin{equation}
	\delta =\lambda_0 f_0L_s \label{eq:delta-f}
\end{equation}
This can be used to derive $\delta$ restrictions from the range of modulation frequencies $f_0$ that can be sampled by the detector. As will be discussed in Subsection \ref{c4.1.2}, this frequency range will depend on the effective detector height $h_e$, pixel size $p$ as well as the distance from the detector to the sample $L_s$. This is also used to estimate the detector $Q$-range, potentially limiting $\delta$ further as discussed in Section \ref{c4.4}.

Finally, an upper $\delta$ limit for which the envelope FWHM of the modulation on the detector reaches a tolerated minimum $FWHM_{e,min}$ is derived from Equation \eqref{eq:poly-base-modulation-env} in Subsection \ref{c4.1.3}. This limit has the unique property that it only depends on $L_s, \Delta\lambda$, and $\lambda_0$, meaning that it is related to the monochromator.

\subsection{Precession device limitations}
\label{c4.1.1}
In terms of instrument design, the engineering of precession devices with a high $\alpha$ and optimizing their positions from the detector $L_1, L_2$ perhaps has the greatest impact on the $\delta$-range. The importance of $L_1, L_2$ comes from the focussing condition, which is $B_1L_1 = -B_2L_2$ for two devices. $\alpha\propto B_1 + B_2$ and $B_1, B_2$ are each limited by device-specific $B_{min}, B_{max}$ as given by Table \ref{tab:device-properties}. It follows that $B_1 + B_2$ is bounded by
$$(B_1 + B_2)_{min} = (\frac{L_1}{L_2} - 1)B_{min}$$
$$(B_1 + B_2)_{max} = (1 - \frac{L_2}{L_1})B_{max}$$
For the minimum value, $B_1 = B_{min}$ and for the maximum value, $B_2 = B_{max}$ with the other set accordingly. Using $\alpha = \frac{c(B_1+B_2)}{\pi\tan\theta_0}$ and $\delta = \lambda_0^2L_s\alpha$, the found $B_1 + B_2$ limitations translate to two $\delta$ constraints
$$\delta_{min, f} = \lambda_0^2 L_s \frac{c(\frac{L_1}{L_2} - 1)B_{min}}{\pi\tan\theta_0}$$
$$\delta_{max, f} = \lambda_0^2 L_s \frac{c(1 - \frac{L_2}{L_1})B_{max}}{\pi\tan\theta_0}$$
\subsection{Detector sampling limitations}
\label{c4.1.2}
Using detector sampling frequency $f_s = \frac{1}{p}$, the Nyquist frequency is $f_n = f_s/2$ and this is an exclusive upper limit at two samples per modulation period, corresponding to 
$$\delta_{max,n} = \frac{\lambda_0L_s}{2p}$$
This can be derived from Equation \eqref{eq:delta-f}. In practice, modulation visibility is reduced when approaching this frequency. One way to avoid this is to set a bound for this effect and solve it numerically as done in \cite{kusmin2017}. A simple alternative to this is to require more samples per period, for instance $5$ instead of $2$ giving
$$\delta_{max,s} = \frac{\lambda_0L_s}{5p}$$
Similarly, the requirement that at least 1 modulation period is visible on the detector restricts the frequency to a minimum of $f_{min} = \frac{1}{h_e}$, corresponding to 
$$\delta_{min,s} = \frac{\lambda_0L_s}{h_e}$$
An alternative and equivalent way of deriving this is through considering the detected $Q$-range, using $Q_{max}$ and $\theta_a$ as described in Section \ref{c3.4}. This gives 
$$Q_{max} = \frac{\pi h_s}{\lambda_0 L_s}$$
This is equivalent to $\delta_{min,s}$ as it satisfies $\delta_{min,s} Q_{max} = \pi$. It also provides an idea of the $Q$-range that reaches the detector, providing a coarse upper limit for $Q$ and accessible characteristic sample lengths. 
\subsection{Modulation envelope width}
\label{c4.1.3}
As discussed before, the modulation can be described by a Gaussian envelope with a FWHM as given by Equation \eqref{eq:poly-base-modulation-fwhm}. Using $\delta = \lambda_0^2L_s\alpha$ and given a $FWHM_{e,min}$, this can be rewritten to a maximum $\delta$ value
$$\delta_{max,e} = \frac{\sqrt{2\ln 2}\lambda_0^2 L_s}{\pi\sigma FWHM_{e,min}}$$
In this way, the intuitive notion that the envelope should not become too narrow to measure enough signal can be translated to a concrete limit by choosing $FWHM_{e,min}$. For monochromators with a low $\Delta\lambda$ and a corresponding low $\sigma$ such as PG monochromators, this will in practice not normally be a limit but it can be when using velocity selectors. The chosen value in this work for $FWHM_{e,min}$ is $\SI{2}{\milli\meter}$, so $20$\% of the effective detector height $h_e$ and it is somewhat permissive.

\subsection{Discussion of design constraints}
The computed $\delta$-ranges and $Q_{max}$ give a first understanding of for what samples the designs can be used to estimate $G(\delta)$ through $G_{\text{exp}}(\delta)$. $\delta$ limits the range of $G(\delta)$'s that can be estimated and $Q_{max}$ gives an indication of how well the bounded integral will approximate the true value. It can be seen that instruments at $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ have a wider $Q$-range given the same $L_s, h_e$ as was to be expected from $Q_{max} \propto 1/\lambda_0$. Correspondingly, these instruments have a lower $\delta_{min}$, making them better able to characterize samples of $\delta \approx \SI{100}{\nano\meter}$. For instruments with triangles and prisms, the condition that at least one modulation period must fit on the detector with effective height $h_e$ is a limiting factor, whereas for foils the devices and their positions $L_1, L_2$ limit $\delta$. Another observation that can be made is that instruments at $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ with a narrower $\lambda$ spectrum are limited more strongly by the upper sampling limit due to detector pixel size $p$ whereas with a wider spectrum at $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$ the narrowing of the modulation envelope becomes a limiting factor. Except for FOIL 8, the upper $\delta$ limit is in these instruments determined by device characteristics together with $L_1, L_2, L_s$ as well as the specific $\lambda_0$ operating point. 

\subsection{Limitations of constraint scheme}
Together, the constraints above give an impression of various factors limiting the achievable $\delta$-range for SEMSANS instruments with $2$ precession devices. It makes it possible to quickly evaluate designs such as those given and identify possibilities to improve them by making the necessary changes. There are some key limitations, however, in particular related to the beam and the detector $Q$-range. As mentioned in Section \ref{c3.4} it is assumed that the beam covers an effective detector height of $h_e$ which translates to requirements for the beam size and/or divergence. The intensity across the beam is assumed to be uniform, which means that the used Gaussian modulation pattern might be too simple of a model for the modulation envelope. As for the $Q$-range, the lower limit imposed by sampling and the precession devices might be too permissive as in practice at the smallest $\delta$, $Q_{max}$ can be too low and $G_\text{exp}(\delta)$ can significantly deviate from $G(\delta)$. This will be touched upon in Section \ref{c4.4}. $B$-resolution limitations and how these could influence the $\delta$-resolution were also not considered. Lastly, all computed constraints are derived from the specific values given in Chapter \ref{c3} in addition to a few chosen limits in the case of $\delta_{\text{max,e}}, \delta_{\text{max,s}}$ that could be relaxed or further constrained. Changing instrument parameters or choosing new limits will result in different values.

\section{Intensity estimate}
\label{c4.3}
In this section, a coarse estimate of intensities as they can be expected using the described designs is derived. Although accurate intensity estimates are beyond the scope of this research, requiring detailed characterizations of losses in all components as well as detailed information about the newly installed cold source, a highly simplified estimate assuming ideal components can be derived as follows.

The original targetted value for the full-spectrum flux at the new cold source beamline corresponding to a reactor power of $\SI{3}{\mega\watt}$ of $\SI{1e9}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$ \cite{OYSTER2008} is taken as a starting point. It is assumed that the intensity of the source has about half the original targetted intensity, so $\Phi_0 = \SI{5e8}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$. Given an operating point $\lambda_0$ with a matching $\sigma$ from the monochromator type, the intensity can be estimated by numerical evaluation of the integral
$$\Phi_{mc} \propto \int_0^\infty f_\lambda(\lambda)e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\lambda - \lambda_0}{\sigma}\right)^2}d\lambda \Phi_0= C_{mc}\Phi_0$$
The transfer of the monochromator is assumed to be a lossless Gaussian, and losses from beam divergence from source to monochromator are neglected.  It can easily be seen from Figure \ref{fig:source-spectrum} that the choice of $\lambda_0$ matters here, as well as the value of $\sigma$. For the used monochromators at $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ and $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$ with $\Delta\lambda = \SI{0.4321}{\angstrom}$ and $\Delta\lambda = \SI{0.8}{\angstrom}$, $C_{mc} = 0.00631826$ and $C_{mc} = 0.07346646$ respectively. Assuming an ideal polariser and an ideal analyzer, the average loss of intensity for $\pm x$ analyzer settings due to these corresponds to a factor $1/4$. To account for losses due to beam divergence, consider the beam divergence to be a small angle $\psi_0$. 
For a uniform beam of radius $R_0$ coming out of the beamline with such a divergence $\phi_0$, it will have expanded to radius $R = R_0 + \psi_0 d$ in small-angle approximation. Simplifying the distribution of neutrons to be uniform over this radius after expansion, the flux at distance $d$ behind the analyzer can be seen to be proportional to
$$\Phi(d) \propto \frac{\Phi_{mc}}{4}\frac{R_0^2}{(R_0 + \psi_0 d)^2} = \frac{\Phi_0}{4}C_{mc}C_{div}$$
Consider $R = \SI{0.1}{\meter}$ to be the radius of the beamline and let $\phi_0 = \SI{2}{\deg}$. Using $d = \SI{6}{\meter}$ as an estimate for the distance of the sample to the beamline gives a divergence loss factor of about $C_{div} = 0.1044$.

Using this approach gives optimistic order of magnitude estimates of the flux at the sample for both $\lambda_0$ options: $100021 \approx \SI{1e5}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$ and $959064 \approx \SI{1e6}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$ for $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ and $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$ respectively. The order of magnitude difference is due to the greater $\Delta\lambda/\lambda_0$ of the velocity selector compared to the PG crystal under the assumption of an optimal Gaussian transfer. As the detector has an area of approximately $\SI{1}{\centi\meter^2}$ and neglecting additional losses due to further divergence, this is also roughly the total intensity at the detector, at least in the absence of a sample or when using a sample that scatters only into a very small $Q$-range. Various losses due to non-ideal components etc. can be expected to reduce these estimates by perhaps another order of magnitude and the relative efficiency of concrete PG monochromators and velocity selectors could cancel the estimated benefit of the velocity selector.

\section{Sample scattering and intensity}
\label{c4.4}
Although so far the accessible $\delta$-range and detector intensity have been discussed separately, the characteristic length of the sample measured will have a tangible effect on the measured intensity. It will also affect the quality of $G_{exp}(\delta)$ as an estimate of $G(\delta)$ limited to $Q_{max}$ for lower $\delta$ and higher $\lambda_0$. This effect was first discussed in the context of SESANS with an instrument for which $\lambda_0 = \SI{2}{\angstrom}$ and $\theta_a \approx \SI{30}{\milli\radian}$ \cite{rekveldt1996}, where it was concluded that for characteristic lengths larger than $\SI{5}{\nano\meter}$ SESANS can be used to reliably estimate $G(\delta)$. Using $L_s = \SI{1.8}{\meter}$ for the instruments considered here, $\theta_a \approx h_e / (2L_s) = \SI{2.8}{\milli\radian}$. With $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ and $\lambda_0 =  \SI{8}{\angstrom}$, this estimated limit translates to about $\SI{100}{\nano\meter}$ and $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ respectively. This indicates that the true $\delta$-range might be more limited using current $h_e, L_s$, and the colder wavelengths. This effect is here verified using a very primitive non-randomized computational approach from which deviation from the ideal regime in which almost all scattered neutrons reach the detector \cite{rekveldt1996} can be seen.

\subsection{Non-randomized single-scattering model}
A very thin, dilute sample of solid spheres as considered in this work has $d\sigma/d\Omega(Q) \propto P(Q)$ at each point in the sample $(s_x, s_y)$ when $\tau = \sigma t\ll 1$. In this case, multiple scattering can be neglected and the transmission can be approximated as $T = e^{-\tau} \approx 1 - \tau$  \cite{rekveldt2003}, meaning that neutrons typically scatter at most once. This approximation is here used to gain a first understanding of how the scattered fraction of neutrons $\tau$ is distributed over the detector.

The form factor $P(Q)$ of a solid sphere is given by Equation \eqref{eq:sample-form-factor}. Assuming a uniform square non-divergent beam where each neutron scatters exactly once of the sample over an area of $10\times10~\unit{\milli\meter}$, the corresponding detector intensity shape of scattered neutrons can be estimated by considering each point in the sample a source of scattering with intensity proportional to $P(Q)$, which can be translated to a point $(x,y)$ on the detector using trigonometry. The beam spectrum is assumed to be monochromatic. The corresponding detector intensity shapes are found by integrating the scattering of many such point sources, a process shown in Figure \ref{fig:simplified-scattering-3D}. 

The intensity was integrated over the $x$-axis to give a single value for each point $y$, which is also how the detector described in Section \ref{c3.4} works. Such integrated intensity profiles for different wavelengths and radii are shown in Figure \ref{fig:simplified-scattering}. It can be seen that the respective estimated limits of $\SI{100}{\nano\meter}$ and $\SI{200}{\nano\meter}$ describe the simplified scattering behavior quite well, with these particle radii being approximately the limit where the middle of the detector picks up almost full intensity uniformly for a certain central width. Figure \ref{fig:simplified-scattering} also gives an idea at which radii error in $G_\text{exp}(\delta)$ becomes significant. This is an effect that can be corrected for \cite{kusmin2017}. It should be noted that Figure \ref{fig:simplified-scattering} only models the intensity of scattered neutrons and ignores multiple scattering by assuming $\tau \ll 1$. The actual scattering power $\tau$ of the sample as well as factors like beam divergence and uniformity will shape the true intensity shapes and $Q$-range of scattered neutrons.  Monte Carlo methods are more suitable for such more accurate calculations and this is the subject of Chapter \ref{c6:monte-carlo}.

\section{Design evaluation}
In this chapter, a wide range of effects limiting the $\delta$-range of designs have been discussed and computed for the design variants listed in Table \ref{tab:design-variants} with their various precession devices and $\lambda_0$-monochromator pairings. An optimistic order of magnitude estimate of intensity was made giving $\SI{1e5}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$ and $\SI{1e6}{\centi\meter^{-2}\sec^{-1}}$ for $\lambda_0 = \SI{4.321}{\angstrom}$ and $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$ respectively, the difference being due to the idealized velocity selector passing through a broader spectrum. The various upper and lower $\delta$-limits imposed by the precession devices, detector, and $\lambda$-spectrum width $\sigma$ were computed and are given in Table \ref{tab:designs-delta-constraints}, resulting in the final $\delta$-ranges as given in Table \ref{tab:designs-final-ranges}. It was also shown that for the given acceptance angle $\theta_a \approx h_e / (2L_s) = \SI{2.8}{\milli\radian}$ at (approximately) maximal sample distance $L_s = \SI{1.8}{\meter}$ it might prove to be difficult to access $\delta\propto \SI{10}{\nano\meter}$. This especially holds for designs with $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$. It would help to decrease $L_s$, increasing $\theta_a$ at the cost of slightly increasing the small-angle error as discussed in Section \ref{c3.5}. Simply decreasing $L_s$ would scale $\delta_{min}, \delta_{max}$ proportionately however, which in almost all cases would not improve the ability of instruments to measure the full target range of $\SI{10}{\nano\meter}$ to $\SI{5}{\micro\meter}$ at a single sample to detector distance $L_s$ considering Table \ref{tab:designs-final-ranges}. Increasing $h_e$ would also increase $\theta_a$ without scaling down the $\delta$ range. Such optimizations with more free parameters like distances $L_s, L_1, L_2$ are the subject of the next chapter. As was to be expected since $\delta \propto \lambda_0^2$, the designs at $\lambda_0 = \SI{8}{\angstrom}$ have higher maximum $\delta$ as well as having a smaller $Q_{max}$. As far as the precession devices are concerned, the great range in terms of $\alpha$ seems to make foil flippers and Wollaston prisms interesting options for an eventual instrument realization. The range of the two instruments using isosceles triangles appears to be too limited to be practical in an instrument that requires a high $\delta_{max}/\delta_{min}$. Although the designs using foil flippers appear to perform the best in the sense of the limits given in Table \ref{tab:designs-final-ranges}, it should be noted that the $\lambda$-dependence \cite{kraan2003} of the foils was not considered here.

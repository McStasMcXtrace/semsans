    "Why is this true? Due to the elastic assumption $|k_i| = |k_f|$ so that whatever the angle between, these will form an isosceles triangle. This can be cut in two to yield two opposite sides of triangles with hypotenuse $k_i$ and angle $\\theta$. In small-angle approximation, $Q = k_i2\\theta$. In other words, $Q$ is $k_i$ times the angle between $k_i$, $k_f$. \n",

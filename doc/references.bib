	abstract = {For the further development of spin-echo techniques to label elastic scattering it is necessary to perform simulations of the Larmor precession of neutron spins in a magnetic field. The details of some of these techniques as implemented at the reactor in Delft are simulated. First, the workings of the magnetized foil flipper are simulated. A full virtual spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering instrument is built and tested without and with a realistic scattering sample. It is essential for these simulations to have a simulated sample that also describes the transmitted beam of unscattered neutrons, which usually is not implemented for the simulation of conventional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) instruments. Finally, the workings of a spin-echo modulated small-angle neutron scattering (SEMSANS) instrument are simulated. The simulations are in good agreement with theory and experiments. This setup can be extended to include realistic magnetic field distributions to fully predict the features of future Larmor labelling elastic-scattering instruments. Configurations can now be simulated for more complicated combinations of SANS with SEMSANS.},

These length scales match nicely those of colloids, protein networks and fat droplets, which are present in many food materials. This makes SESANS an excellent probe to study food materials. An interesting feature of SESANS is the real space character of the raw data. Several examples of quantitative neutron scattering studies on food materials are shortly reviewed.}

These micron-size length scales can be probed using a method analogous to SESANS and MIEZE; a spatial modulation of the beam intensity with a Larmor precession technique. Measurements on a test instrument of this specific Larmor precession technique are in good agreement with the prediction. All components for this technique may fit in the collimator section of a conventional SANS instrument which makes the spectrometer sensitive for length scales from 1nm up till 100μm.}

	abstract = {We modulated the intensity of a neutron beam using Larmor precession techniques. We simulated triangular coils by using magnetised foils in electromagnets with rectangular pole shoes. Reversing the orientation of two of the magnetised foils in the spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering (SESANS)-instrument in Delft and changing the field settings was sufficient to obtain a modulation with a period in the order of 1mm. We expect to be able to go to a modulation with a period of 20μm. This technique can be used to measure small-angle neutron scattering, analogous to the method used in SESANS, but with the advantage that all the manipulation of the neutron spin occurs before the sample. This means that the technique is insensitive to magnetic perturbations at the sample position. By positioning several of these devices after each other it will be possible to obtain a sharper modulation, or a modulation in two directions.}

These instruments concern small angle scattering, neutron reflectometry and high-resolution diffraction. The advantages of the first application, spin echo small angle scattering (SESANS), with respect to conventional SANS, is the range of applicability and orders of magnitude higher available intensity. The reflectometry application makes it possible to measure the momentum dependent intensity without hindrance of the waviness of the sample also with the high intensity of SESANS. The high resolution application enables one to measure very high resolution diffraction (10−5 relative in momentum space) without angular of wavelength confinement of the beam, thus with very high intensity.",

Here a direct real-space interpretation of {\it G}({\it Z}) through the particle scattering density and pair correlation function is given. One-dimensional and two-dimensional SESANS are compared. The case of non-interacting particles is considered in detail with an explicit geometrical interpretation. General methods for the calculation of structural parameters, such as the total scattering length and the radius of gyration, are developed. Analytical expressions of {\it G}({\it Z}) for non-interacting solid spheres, hollow spheres and Gaussian coils are derived. The case of solid spheres is compared with experimental data.},

	abstract = {Following a recent report by Keller et al. in Neutron News 6, no. 3 (1995), the application of neutron spin echo as a small angle neutron scattering instrument (SESANS) using dc magnetic fields is discussed. The principle is based on the difference in Larmor precession angle in a coil with changing transmission angle, caused by scattering from a sample. A scattering object between two identical coils with opposite precessions causes depolarisation. The latter as a function of the precession field yields a real space correlation function. A modification of this principle of SESANS is introduced enabling to suppress the contribution of inelastic scattering, which changes the precession angle too. The application of this technique is very promising for systems with large correlation lengths and may enable one to measure time dependent effects in correlation lengths with a time resolution of a few seconds. The latter corresponds to the time needed to measure a complete spectrum from which a correlation function in real space is derived.}

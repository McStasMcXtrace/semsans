# BEP

Repository for my thesis project. The goal is to develop SEMSANS instruments at cold neutron sources to probe the sub-micron range and this repository will contain the relevant simulations.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, first install [McStas](https://www.mcstas.org/) 3.4. At the time of writing for Ubuntu, `sudo apt install mcstas-suite-python-ng` installs everything you need. Next, create a new Python environment and install [McStasScript](https://pypi.org/project/McStasScript/) 0.0.67 into it.
